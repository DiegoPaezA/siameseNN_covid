## Abstract

The sequelae generated in patients by Covit-19 can lead to complications, so in the diagnostic phase it is essential that the specialist performs various tests that allow him to know about them and assess the case in advance. Chest X-ray tests provide
images, which in turn can be used in deep learning techniques for image processing and modelling. The Siamese Neural Network technique allows a pair of images to be processed and provide comparable results between them, which is interesting and useful
when trying to recognise certain images within many classes of images. The Siamese Neural Network proposed here is configured with VGG11 and Loss Contraastive Function for the comparison of the pair of images. The results show an accuracy of 0.938
during training and validation, and a loss rate of 0.078 during training.
